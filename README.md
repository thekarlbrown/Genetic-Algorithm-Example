Genetic Algorithm

This functions to test my knowledge of genetic algorithms and their implementations. It consists of abstract base classes for both the Genetic Algorithm and its Chromosome. 

This code features aggregation between the two classes, encapsulation of certain aspects of each class, and parametric polymorphism to allow easy extension for more implementations than just my string example.

Also featured is my own interpretation of a Roulette Wheel algorithm to handle random selection of Chromosome's weighted by Fitness Score.
